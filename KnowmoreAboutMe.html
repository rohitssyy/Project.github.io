    <H1>Hello there!!! </H1>
    <pre style="font-size: 130%;">
        you already know my name and as i said earlier i am from varanasi currently living in Bangalore
        right now i am in college in second semester doing BCA and todays date is 22 February 2023
        i must admit time is moving very fast i coudn't pace up with everything
        i am sort of lonely these days cause i am learning a lot of things and i have my own agenda 
        although i have good social life but i am kinda avoiding everything cause right now i want to focus on my 
        career i know people say college is the time to enjoy yourself find yourself
        in reality its actually opposite college is kinda the place where you have pull your shit together otherwise
        things wont go your in life easy this is the place where you training starts for the cruel world 
        this is place where you get ready for the battle..... 
        this is place where you will choose where your life will take for the rest of your life
        thats why i keep myself exclusive these days although i love talking
        i wouldn't say i am extrovert not introvert because i have been both 
        really so for me i dont put myself in one cateogry that i am this or i am that i never do
        it just ridicule and doesn't make any sense i mean why i want categorize myself on my choices which
        i have made in the past THINK ABOUT IT.
        i entertain all thoughts
        i dont take side even if i do i keep it to myself and if neccessary then only i put it out
        i am mature but silly at the same time
        i admire the beauty of silliest things you notice on your day-to-day life at the same time i dont care about anything at all.
